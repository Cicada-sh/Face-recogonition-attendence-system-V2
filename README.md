## üì± Usage Guide

### 1. Setup (First Time)

1. Navigate to the **Setup** page
2. Enter student information (Name and Student ID)
3. Start the camera and capture 5-8 photos from different angles
4. Click "Train Face Recognition" to save the student's face data
5. Repeat for all students

### 2. Attendance Tracking

1. Go to the main **Attendance** page
2. Click "Start Camera" to begin face detection
3. Students will be automatically marked present when detected
4. View real-time attendance logs and statistics

### 3. Teacher Dashboard

1. Click "Teacher Login" and use credentials:
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `admin`
2. View comprehensive attendance analytics
3. Monitor student attendance rates
4. Access weekly attendance trends

## üéØ Key Features for Accuracy

### Multiple Face Encodings
- Each student is trained with 3-8 different face images
- Captures various angles and expressions
- Reduces false negatives and improves recognition

### High Confidence Threshold
- Uses 60% confidence threshold for attendance marking
- Prevents false positives from similar-looking faces
- Displays confidence percentage for each detection

### Advanced Face Detection
- Uses OpenCV's Haar cascades for face detection
- Face recognition library for encoding comparison
- Real-time processing with optimized performance

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Students Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `name`: Student's full name
- `student_id`: Unique student identifier
- `face_encodings`: JSON array of face encodings
- `created_at`: Registration timestamp

### Attendance Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `student_id`: Foreign key to students
- `date`: Attendance date
- `time`: Attendance time
- `confidence`: Recognition confidence score

### Teachers Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `username`: Teacher username
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password

## üîß API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/login` - Teacher login
- `POST /api/logout` - Teacher logout

### Face Recognition
- `POST /api/process-attendance` - Process camera frame for attendance
- `POST /api/train-face` - Train face recognition for new student

### Data Retrieval
- `GET /api/attendance-stats` - Get attendance statistics
- `GET /api/students` - Get list of registered students

## üé® Web Pages

1. **Attendance Page** (`/`) - Real-time face detection and attendance marking
2. **Teacher Login** (`/teacher-login`) - Secure authentication for teachers
3. **Teacher Dashboard** (`/teacher-dashboard`) - Analytics and student management
4. **Setup Page** (`/setup`) - Face training and student registration

## üîí Security Features

- Password hashing using SHA-256
- Session-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure API endpoints with authentication checks

## üìä Performance Optimization

- Efficient face encoding storage
- Optimized camera frame processing
- Database indexing for fast queries
- Responsive web design for all devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not working**
   - Check browser permissions for camera access
   - Ensure no other applications are using the camera
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Low recognition accuracy**
   - Capture more photos during training (5-8 recommended)
   - Ensure good lighting conditions
   - Make sure faces are clearly visible and centered

3. **Database errors**
   - Delete `attendance.db` file and restart the application
   - Check file permissions in the project directory

### System Requirements

- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM, 2GB free disk space
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM, 5GB free disk space
- **Camera**: 720p or higher resolution webcam
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)
